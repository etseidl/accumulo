// singleton to manage per-thread RegionTimer instances.  kind of
// annoying that I have to use HashMap (modernizer complained about
// Hashtable, which is synchronized) rather than ConcurrentHashMap
// due to spot-bugs flagging the non-atomic check/put.  Should figure
// out how to suppress, since only the current thread can supply
// the missing key...don't have to worry about another thread adding
// this thread to the map.  Oh well, I don't expect this to be
// called all that often so it shouldn't be a big issue...just be
// sure to call once and save a timer, rather than repeatedly
// calling timerForThread() inside loops, say.
